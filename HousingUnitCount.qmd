In September of 2015, the Washington Post [analyzed census data to asses the breakdown of housing by unit count](https://tinyurl.com/bdd2nx45) for major American cities. After reading that article, I had a lot of follow-up questions and interest in how other cities and housing types shook out.

First, the Washington Post analysis only included *large* U.S. cities. If we include cities down to 50,000 population, are there any that had a lower proportion of single-family detached housing than New York or Philadelphia?

As it turned out, yes, there are! They broadly fall into 2 categories:

1.  Concentrated high density.

2.  Single-family attached houses (rowhouses or townhouses) as a default instead of single-family detached houses.

This is what high density looks like: , such as New York and surroundings, Florida beachside communities with extensive condo development, and other urban centers like D.C. and Boston.Just how geographically concentrated type 1 cities are into "major cities" and "Florida condo communities" becomes especially clear when sorted by the densest housing types:

This occurs almost exclusively in Philadelphia and surroundings. the rowhouse-dominated cities are a class of their own, almost exclusively falling in the mid-Atlantic:

All of the top 19 are located in this narrow region of the US, with only #20 being located elsewhere (Palm Desert, CA).

Finally, what about the opposite? Where do we find the cities with the *most* single-family detached housing?

It's actually quite rare to find cities of over 50,000 people where over 90% of occupied units are single-family detached housing. Of those that are, several are planned communities such as The Villages or Levittowns that were explicitly intended to only contain single-family detached housing.

Urbanists frequently talk about a "missing middle" of housing: more dense than single-family housing but less so than mid-rise apartments:

What U.S. cities already have the highest proportion of this type of housing?

Older, mid-sized Northeastern cities, as it turns out. These are places in which the housing stock was mostly constructed before automobiles but also places that did not grow so large or dense that this housing got torn down and replaced with higher density.
