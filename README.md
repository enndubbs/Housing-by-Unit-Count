# Housing-by-Unit-Count
Data and R Project files for https://www.noahwright.com/HousingUnitCount.html, an extension of a Washington Post analysis of housing by unit type in major U.S. cities. Files in R/ prep data for markdown, and the quarto files in the main directory (HousingUnitCount.qmd, HousingUnitCountChi.qmd) generate the resulting article.
